## Pick The Smallest Hook

Choose the lightest visual hook that matches the job:

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Swap a packaged visuals scene | `CharacterAssetProfile.Scenes.VisualsPath` or `MonsterAssetProfile.VisualsScenePath` |
| Use static frame cues | `VisualCueSet` on `CharacterAssetProfile` |
| Build the node tree in code | Override `TryCreateCreatureVisuals()` |
| Drive combat animations yourself | Override `SetupCustomCombatAnimationStateMachine(...)` |
| Drive merchant / rest-site visuals | Override `SetupCustomMerchantAnimationStateMachine(...)` or `WorldProceduralVisuals` |

Start with paths and profiles. Move to factories only when static resources cannot express the behavior.

## Visual Cues

`VisualCueSet` is useful for non-Spine characters that can be described by named stills or frame sequences.

```csharp
public override CharacterAssetProfile AssetProfile => new()
{
    VisualCues = new VisualCueSet(
        texturePathByCue: new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            ["idle"] = "res://MyMod/images/character/idle.png",
            ["hit"] = "res://MyMod/images/character/hit.png",
        })
};
```

Keep cue names aligned with the animation states your model or state machine will request.

## State Machines

Use `ModAnimStateMachines` or `ModAnimStateMachineBuilder` when you need explicit animation state transitions.

```csharp
protected override ModAnimStateMachine? SetupCustomCombatAnimationStateMachine(
    Node visualsRoot,
    CharacterModel character)
{
    return ModAnimStateMachines.Standard(
        CompositeBackendFactory.FromNode(visualsRoot));
}
```

Return `null` when the normal vanilla animation path should run.

## Practical Notes

- Keep visual resources in the mod PCK and reference them with `res://`.
- Register Godot scripts before any scene is instantiated.
- Use one visible fallback pose for every non-Spine creature.
- Test death, hit, attack, cast, idle, and relaxed states before release.
- For merchant and rest-site visuals, verify both normal UI entry and reload-from-save paths.

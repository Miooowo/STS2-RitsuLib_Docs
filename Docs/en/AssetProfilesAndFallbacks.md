# Asset Profiles And Fallbacks

## Use Profiles First

When a template exposes `AssetProfile`, put paths there instead of patching UI nodes.

```csharp
public sealed class MyCard : ModCardTemplate(1, CardType.Attack, CardRarity.Common, TargetType.SingleEnemy)
{
    public override CardAssetProfile AssetProfile => new()
    {
        PortraitPath = "res://MyMod/images/cards/my_card.png",
        EnergyIconPath = "res://MyMod/images/ui/energy_orange.png",
        FrameMaterialPath = "res://MyMod/materials/card_frame_orange.tres",
    };
}
```

RitsuLib reads only non-empty fields. Missing fields keep the base game value or the template fallback.

## Supported Profiles

| Content | Profile |
| --- | --- |
| Card | `CardAssetProfile` |
| Relic | `RelicAssetProfile` |
| Power | `PowerAssetProfile` |
| Orb | `OrbAssetProfile` |
| Potion | `PotionAssetProfile` |
| Affliction | `AfflictionAssetProfile` |
| Enchantment | `EnchantmentAssetProfile` |
| Act | `ActAssetProfile` |
| Monster | `MonsterAssetProfile` |
| Encounter | `EncounterAssetProfile` |
| Event / ancient event layout | `EventAssetProfile` |
| Ancient map / run-history presentation | `AncientEventPresentationAssetProfile` |
| Rest site option | `RestSiteOptionAssetProfile` |
| Epoch portrait | `EpochAssetProfile` |
| Character | `CharacterAssetProfile` |

Use `ContentAssetProfiles.*(...)` only when you intentionally borrow a base-game path convention. For mod art, explicit `res://MyMod/...` paths are easier to review.

## Character Profiles

Character assets are grouped by purpose:

```csharp
public override CharacterAssetProfile AssetProfile => new()
{
    Scenes = new()
    {
        VisualsPath = "res://MyMod/scenes/characters/my_character_visuals.tscn",
        EnergyCounterPath = "res://MyMod/scenes/ui/my_energy_counter.tscn",
    },
    Ui = new()
    {
        CharacterSelectIconPath = "res://MyMod/images/character/select_icon.png",
        MapMarkerPath = "res://MyMod/images/character/map_marker.png",
    },
    Audio = new()
    {
        AttackSfx = "event:/MyMod/character_attack",
    },
};
```

`PlaceholderCharacterId` lets a partial profile borrow missing fields from a vanilla character. Use it as a temporary scaffold, then replace important visible assets before release.

## Missing Paths

Check resource paths before release. If a path is missing, RitsuLib logs a warning and keeps a fallback where one exists. Character visuals have fewer safe base-game fallbacks than cards or relics, so treat character path warnings as release blockers.
